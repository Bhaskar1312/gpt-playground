BB: Use Spring Expression language and call a custom method in a class to implement method security in spring boot
GPT:
To implement method security in Spring Boot using Spring Expression Language (SpEL) and a custom method in a class, you can follow these steps:
  1. Create a custom method in a class that will be used to check whether a user has the necessary permissions to access a method.
     For example, let's create a method called hasPermission in a class called PermissionEvaluator:
     ```
     @Component
public class PermissionEvaluator {
    public boolean hasPermission(Authentication authentication, Object targetObject, Object permission) {
        // implementation of the method to check permissions
    }
}
     ```
   2. In the Spring Security configuration class, configure method security by adding the @EnableGlobalMethodSecurity annotation 
      and setting the prePostEnabled attribute to true to enable method-level security annotations:
      ```
      @Configuration
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)
public class MethodSecurityConfig extends GlobalMethodSecurityConfiguration {
    // configuration of method security
}

      ```
    3. Create a security expression that will call the custom method hasPermission in the PermissionEvaluator class. The security expression will be used in the method-level 
       security annotation. For example, let's create a security expression that checks if a user has the ROLE_ADMIN role:
       ```
       @PreAuthorize("hasPermission(#authentication, #targetObject, 'ROLE_ADMIN')")
public void someMethod(Authentication authentication, Object targetObject) {
    // implementation of the secured method
}

       ```
      4. Use the security expression in the method-level security annotation to secure a method. For example, let's secure a method called someMethod:
      ```
      @Service
public class MyService {
    @PreAuthorize

      ```
      
      network error

Step 4: Configure the security for method-level access by adding the @EnableGlobalMethodSecurity annotation to your security configuration class
 with prePostEnabled attribute set to true, and the @PreAuthorize annotation on the methods to be secured. The @PreAuthorize annotation will evaluate
 the SpEL expression to check if the user has permission to access the method.

Here's an example configuration:
```
@Configuration
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)
public class MethodSecurityConfig extends GlobalMethodSecurityConfiguration {

    @Autowired
    private CustomSecurity customSecurity;

    @Override
    protected MethodSecurityExpressionHandler createExpressionHandler() {
        DefaultMethodSecurityExpressionHandler expressionHandler = new DefaultMethodSecurityExpressionHandler();
        expressionHandler.setPermissionEvaluator(new CustomPermissionEvaluator(customSecurity));
        return expressionHandler;
    }

}


```
In the above example, we have defined a CustomSecurity class and autowired it in the MethodSecurityConfig class. We then override the createExpressionHandler method to create a custom expression handler that sets our CustomSecurity class as the PermissionEvaluator used by the @PreAuthorize annotation.

Step 5: Use the @PreAuthorize annotation to secure the method. Here's an example:
@Service
public class MyService {

    @PreAuthorize("@customSecurity.hasPermission(#resource)")
    public void doSomething(String resource) {
        // Your logic for the secured method
    }

}
